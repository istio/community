# Istio Steering Committee

The Istio Steering Committee was formed to oversee the administrative aspects of the project, including governance, branding, and marketing.
Steering was created to allow the Technical Oversight Committee to exclusively focus on the technical aspects of the project.

media accounts.
1. Providing neutral mediation as appropriate to try to resolve non-technical
disputes that arise as part of the project.

## Membership and voting
1.  The Steering Committee is structured to allow companies who are most
invested in the success of the Istio project to participate in business and
non-technical decision-making.
1.  All members should abide by the project Code of Conduct.
1.  There are two types of seats on the Steering Committee: Contributor Seats
and Community Seats.
1.  Both Contributor and Community Seats will be appointed beginning in
July 2020. The appointments for the Contribution and Community seat types will
expire on staggered dates. After the initial term for both seats, all seats
will have an annual term.
1.  Contributor Seat terms expire on January 1 and Community Seat terms expire
on July 1. If necessary, a company holding a Contributor Seat may change the
appointed individual at any time during the term.
1.  No Contributing Company can have more than 5 seats in total on the Steering
Committee.
    1.  Subsidiaries, an entity in which another company owns more than 50%
    of the voting or membership interests; and related companies, companies
    which are controlled by a common third party entity; and affiliate
    companies, will be treated together as a single entity, referred to as a
    Contributing Company.
1.  There shall be nine **Contributor Seats**. Their allocation is determined
by the approximate effort and expenditure on the Istio project, as approximated
by the number of merged pull requests on GitHub over the one year period prior
to the Contributor Seat assignments:
    1.  The top three contributing companies to Istio are eligible for
    Contributor Seats, proportional to their contribution.
        1.  Each company is allocated one seat;
        1.  The remaining six seats are allocated based on percentage project
        contribution, with no Contributing Company exceeding 5 seats in total
        as outlined in section 6.
1.  There shall be four **Community Seats.**
    1.  Two **Community Seats** will be elected by the Istio contributors and
    community, beginning in July 2020.
        1.  Any [project member](ROLES.md#member) can self-nominate for the
        election, or nominate another project member with their consent.
        1.  Elections use time-limited, Condorcet voting.
        1.  The following are eligible to vote for Community Seats:
            1.  Project [Members](ROLES.md#member) who have had a merged PR in
            the 12 months prior to the election; and
            1.  People who have submitted a voting exception form to the
            Steering Committee, demonstrating contribution to the Istio project
            that is of a non-code nature in the 12 months prior to the election,
            and are granted a vote for the election by a simple majority vote of
            the Steering Committee.
        1.  Community Seats are maintained for the term by the individual, even
        if they change their company affiliation.
            1.  If an individual changes company affiliation mid-term in a way
            that is incompatible with the company representation policies in
            this Charter, the individual may keep their seat for the duration of
            the term.
    1.  Two Community Seats will be appointed through a vote of the Steering
    Committee after the community election.
        1.  These seats are intended to diversify perspectives and expertise on
        the Committee.
    1.  Because the goal of Community Seats is to increase the perspectives on
    the Steering Committee, employees of a Contributing Company are ineligible
    to be elected to hold a Community Seat.
1.  At all meetings of the Steering Committee, at least 60% of the Seats shall
constitute a quorum for voting purposes. The vote of an affirmative vote of 60%
of the Seats present at the time of the vote shall be the decision of the
Steering Committee. However, any changes to the Steering Committee Charter shall
require both a quorum and a vote of 80% of the Steering Committee Seats.

## Committee meetings

The Istio Steering Committee meets weekly.
Given the nature of the discussions in Steering, meetings are not currently open to the public. Questions around governance are listed as [issues in the community repo](https://github.com/istio/community/labels/steering-governance), and we invite your feedback there.

## Committee members

Seats in Steering are held by a company, not by the individual users. Currently Steering consists of members from Google, IBM & Red Hat. These are:

## General questions

*Why Are Seats Company Held?*

When the Istio project was founded, we decided that having strong corporate
leadership was needed for the project to ensure continued velocity.

In that case, the company will select another representative to hold the seat.
This has happened twice to date. Dan Berg filled a seat vacated by Shriram
Rajagopalan, and Dan Ciruli filled a seat vacated by Varun Talwar.

*What Happens If Someone Leaves the Project or Decides to Leave Steering?*

The same applies; the company will select another representative to hold the seat.

*What Happens If Someone Leaves the Project or Decides to Leave Steering?*

The same applies; the company will select another representative to hold the seat.
