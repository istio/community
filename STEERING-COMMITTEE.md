# Istio Steering Committee

The Istio Steering Committee was formed to oversee the administrative aspects of the project, including governance, branding, and marketing.
Steering was created to allow the Technical Oversight Committee to exclusively focus on the technical aspects of the project.

1. Controlling and delegating access to, and establishing processes regarding,
project resources/assets, including but not limited to artifact repositories,

## Membership and voting

1. A Company shall mean an entity which employs a member, and all other
entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that
entity.
1. The Steering Committee is structured to allow Companies who are most
invested in the success of the Istio project to participate in business and
non-technical decision-making.
1. All members should abide by the project Code of Conduct.
1. There are two types of seats on the Steering Committee: Contribution Seats
and Community Seats.
1. Both Contribution and Community Seats will be appointed beginning in
August 2020. The appointments for the Contribution and Community seat types will
expire on staggered dates. After the initial term for both seats, all seats
will have an annual term.
1. Contribution Seat terms expire on January 31 and Community Seat terms expire
on July 31. If necessary, a company holding a Contribution Seat may change the
appointed individual at any time during the term.
1. No Company can have more than 5 seats in total on the Steering Committee.
1. There shall be nine **Contribution Seats**.  Their allocation is determined
by the approximate effort and expenditure on the Istio project. Each year, when
Contribution Seat terms begin, the Steering Committee will vote on an exact
formula and procedure for determining allocation for the following year.
That procedure will be published to the istio/community repository;
modifications subsequent to the annual publication of rules shall be considered
modifications to the Steering Committee Charter.
    1. At least three Companies shall be represented in the Contribution Seat
    membership. If the formula and procedure would not award seats to at least
    three Companies, then the third highest Company shall be awarded a seat,
    and then the formula and procedure shall be applied to eight seats instead
    of nine.
1. There shall be four **Community Seats** elected by the Istio contributors
and community, beginning in August 2020.
    1. Any [project member](ROLES.md#member) can self-nominate for the
    election, or nominate another project member with their consent.
    1. Elections shall use time-limited, Condorcet voting.
    1. The following are eligible to vote for Community Seats:
        1. [Project members](ROLES.md#member) who have had a merged PR in
        the 12 months prior to the election; and
        1. People who have submitted a voting exception form to the
        Steering Committee, demonstrating contribution to the Istio project
        that is of a non-code nature in the 12 months prior to the election,
        and are granted a vote for the election by a simple majority vote of
        the Steering Committee.
    1. No Company can hold more than one Community Seat.
    1. Community Seats are maintained for the term by the individual, even
    if they change their Company affiliation.
        1. If an individual changes company affiliation mid-term in a way
        that is incompatible with the Company representation policies in
        this Charter, the individual will be considered to have resigned
        their seat and the first eligible runner-up from the previous
        election will replace them for the duration of the term. If there
        is no first runner-up eligible to serve in the as per these rules,
        then the Steering Committee shall vote by simple majority to replace
        the seat for the term.
    1. Because the goal of Community Seats is to increase the perspectives on
    the Steering Committee, employees of a Company that holds Contribution
    Seats are ineligible to be elected to hold a Community Seat.
1. A simple majority of Seats shall be sufficient to call a vote of the
Steering Committee, one nominating, and the rest agreeing, over email. Voting
shall be done electronically, in a manner agreed on by the Steering Committee.
Voting shall be open for nine calendar days, after which point it shall close.
If at any point all the Steering Committee members have voted or abstained,
voting shall close.
1. An affirmative vote of at least 60% of the Seats shall be the decision of
the Steering Committee. However, any changes to the Steering Committee charter
Charter shall require an affirmative vote of at least 80% of the Seats.

## Committee meetings

The Istio Steering Committee meets weekly.
Given the nature of the discussions in Steering, meetings are not currently open to the public. Questions around governance are listed as [issues in the community repo](https://github.com/istio/community/labels/steering-governance), and we invite your feedback there.
