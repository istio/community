## Membership and voting
1.  The Steering Committee is structured to allow companies who are most
invested in the success of the Istio project to participate in business and
non-technical decision-making.
1.  All members should abide by the project
[Code of Conduct](CONTRIBUTING.md#code-of-conduct).
1.  There are two types of seats on the Steering Committee: Contribution Seats
and Community Seats.
1.  Both Contributor and Community Seats will be appointed beginning in
July 2020. The appointments for the Contribution and Community seat types will
expire on staggered dates. After the initial term for both seats, all seats
will have an annual term.
1.  Contribution Seat terms expire on January 31 and Community Seat terms expire
on July 31. If necessary, a company holding a Contribution Seat may change the
appointed individual at any time during the term.
1.  No Contributing Company can have more than 5 seats in total on the Steering
Committee.
    1.  Subsidiaries, an entity in which another company owns more than 50%
    of the voting or membership interests; and related companies, companies
    which are controlled by a common third party entity; and affiliate
    companies, will be treated together as a single entity, referred to as a
    Contributing Company.
1.  There shall be nine **Contribution Seats**.  Their allocation is determined
by the approximate effort and expenditure on the Istio project.  Each year, the
Steering Committee will meet and vote on an exact formula and procedure for
determining allocation, and publish this to the istio/community repository;
modifications subsequent to the annual publication of rules shall be considered
modifications to the Steering Committee Charter.
    1.  The top three contributing companies to Istio are eligible for
    Contribution Seats, proportional to their contribution.
        1.  Each company is allocated one seat;
        1.  The remaining six seats are allocated based on percentage project
        contribution, with no Contributing Company exceeding 5 seats in total
        as outlined in section 6.
1.  There shall be four **Community Seats.**
    1.  Two **Community Seats** will be elected by the Istio contributors and
    community, beginning in July 2020.
        1.  Any [project member](ROLES.md#member) can self-nominate for the
        election, or nominate another project member with their consent.
        1.  Elections use time-limited, Condorcet voting.
        1.  The following are eligible to vote for Community Seats:
            1.  Project [Members](ROLES.md#member) who have had a merged PR in
            the 12 months prior to the election; and
            1.  People who have submitted a voting exception form to the
            Steering Committee, demonstrating contribution to the Istio project
            that is of a non-code nature in the 12 months prior to the election,
            and are granted a vote for the election by a simple majority vote of
            the Steering Committee.
        1.  No Contributing Company can hold more than one Community Seat.
        1.  Community Seats are maintained for the term by the individual, even
        if they change their company affiliation.
            1.  If an individual changes company affiliation mid-term in a way
            that is incompatible with the company representation policies in
            this Charter, the individual will be considered to have resigned
            their seat and the first eligible runner-up from the previous
            election will replace them for the duration of the term. If there
            is no first runner-up eligible to serve in the as per these rules,
            then the Steering Committee shall vote by simple majority to replace
            the seat for the term.
            1.  Because the goal of Community Seats is to increase the
            perspectives on the Steering Committee, employees of a Contributing
            Company are ineligible to be elected to hold a Community Seat.
1.  A simple majority of Seats shall be sufficient to convene a meeting of the
Steering Committee, one nominating, and the rest agreeing, over email. Meeting
proposals shall be circulated to all Seats, and time, location, and medium shall
be selected to be as convenient as possible. All Seats shall be given at least
one week written notice that a meeting of the Steering Committee will be held.
1. At all meetings of the Steering Committee convened under this charter, at
least 60% of the Seats shall constitute a quorum for voting purposes. The vote
of an affirmative vote of 60% of the Seats present at the time of the vote shall
be the decision of the Steering Committee. However, any changes to the Steering
Committee Charter shall require a vote of 80% of the Steering Committee Seats.

## Committee meetings

The Istio Steering Committee meets weekly.
Given the nature of the discussions in Steering, meetings are not currently open to the public. Questions around governance are listed as [issues in the community repo](https://github.com/istio/community/labels/steering-governance), and we invite your feedback there.

## Committee members

Seats in Steering are held by a company, not by the individual users. Currently Steering consists of members from Google, IBM & Red Hat. These are:

## General questions

*Why Are Seats Company Held?*

When the Istio project was founded, we decided that having strong corporate
leadership was needed for the project to ensure continued velocity.

*What Happens If Someone Leaves the Project or Decides to Leave Steering?*

In that case, the company will select another representative to hold the seat.

*What Happens If Someone Leaves the Project or Decides to Leave Steering?*

The same applies; the company will select another representative to hold the
seat.
