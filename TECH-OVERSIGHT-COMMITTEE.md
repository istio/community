## Committee meetings

The TOC meets regularly. The meetings are open to anyone interested, so please join us. The meeting schedule is tracked
on the [working group calendar](WORKING-GROUPS.md#working-group-meetings); please follow the link for more details.

Community members are encouraged to suggest topics for discussion ahead of the TOC meetings, and are invited
to observe these meetings and engage with the TOC. To suggest a topic, add it to the [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13lxJqtlaQhmV2EwsNnS6h-_O4pobZQZuMjrzOeMgVI0/edit#heading=h.ipnfbx7g04vg).

## Selection and eligibility

Because the group is expected to form, and operate by consensus, there are an even number of seats.

Membership in the TOC is determined by a majority vote of the [Steering Committee](./steering/README.md).

While Steering seats are allocated to companies, TOC seats are allocated to individuals, and remain with a person if that person moves to a new employer.

In the event of a vacancy on the TOC, the Steering Committee will solicit candidates for election from the eligible candidates. Eligible candidates are those who have been members of the Istio project for at least a year, and a maintainer for at least six months.
