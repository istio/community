# Steering Committee

The Istio Steering Committee was formed to oversee the administrative aspects of the project, including governance, branding, and marketing.
Steering was created to allow the [Technical Oversight Committee](../TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md) to exclusively focus on the technical aspects of the project.

## Charter

See [CHARTER.md](CHARTER.md).

## Contribution Seats

For February 2024 to January 2025, the nine Contribution Seats were [allocated](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OIwf11xdL3VHi18uhOnHMwQnlXBS22vvhL0m1qraIds/edit#gid=1365082320) per the [agreed formula and process](CONTRIBUTION-FORMULA.md).

## Elections

Every year, four members of the Steering Committee are voted on by the community. Check out the [2023 election guide](elections/2023/).

## Meetings

The Istio Steering Committee meets weekly.
Given the nature of the discussions in Steering, meetings are not currently open to the public. Questions around governance are listed as [issues in the community repo](https://github.com/istio/community/labels/steering-governance), and we invite your feedback there.
