# Steering Committee

The Istio Steering Committee was formed to oversee the administrative aspects of the project, including governance, branding, and marketing.
Steering was created to allow the [Technical Oversight Committee](../TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md) to exclusively focus on the technical aspects of the project.

## Charter

See [CHARTER.md](CHARTER.md).
