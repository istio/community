## Contribution Seats

For March 2025 to February 2026, the nine Contribution Seats were [allocated](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Pt5LjX95azzrbWP-73EkKV79enlbaGut1hN-JTor1g/edit?gid=1365082320) per the [agreed formula and process](CONTRIBUTION-FORMULA.md).

## Elections

Every year, four members of the Steering Committee are voted on by the community. Check out the [2025 election guide](elections/2025/).

## Meetings

The Istio Steering Committee meets weekly.
Given the nature of the discussions in Steering, meetings are not currently open to the public. Questions around governance are listed as [issues in the community repo](https://github.com/istio/community/labels/steering-governance), and we invite your feedback there.
