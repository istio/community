## Membership and voting

1. A Company shall mean an entity which employs a member, and all other
entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that
entity.
1. The Steering Committee is structured to allow Companies who are most
invested in the success of the Istio project to participate in business and
non-technical decision-making.
1. All members must abide by the project Code of Conduct.
1. There are two types of seats on the Steering Committee: Contribution Seats
and Community Seats. All seats will have an annual term, starting at the
completion of each annual Contribution Seat election.
1. No Company can have more than five seats in total on the Steering Committee.
1. There shall be nine **Contribution Seats**.  Their allocation is determined
by the approximate effort and expenditure on the Istio project. Each year, when
the Steering Committee term begins, the Steering Committee will vote on an 
exact formula and procedure for determining allocation for the following year.
That procedure will be published to the istio/community repository;
modifications subsequent to the annual publication of rules shall be considered
modifications to the Steering Committee Charter.
    1. At least three Companies shall be represented in the Contribution Seat
    membership. If the formula and procedure would not award seats to at least
    three Companies, then the third highest Company shall be awarded a seat,
    and then the formula and procedure shall be applied to eight seats instead
    of nine.
1. Contribution Seats will be calculated on February 1 each year, based on the
agreed formula and procedure for the preceding 12 months. Contribution Seats
shall become active at the conclusion of the Community Seat election which
immediately follows their allocation.
1. If necessary, a company holding a Contribution Seat may change the appointed
individual at any time during the term.
1. There shall be four **Community Seats** elected by the Istio contributors
and community.
    1. Any [project member](../ROLES.md#member) can self-nominate for the
    election, or nominate another project member with their consent.
    1. Elections shall use time-limited, Condorcet voting.
    1. The following are eligible to vote for Community Seats:
        1. [Project members](../ROLES.md#member) who have had a merged PR in
        the 12 months prior to the election; and
        1. People who have submitted a voting exception form to the
        Steering Committee, demonstrating contribution to the Istio project
        that is of a non-code nature in the 12 months prior to the election,
        and are granted a vote for the election by a simple majority vote of
        the Steering Committee.
    1. No Company can hold more than one Community Seat.
    1. Community Seats are maintained for the term by the individual, even
    if they change their Company affiliation.
        1. If an individual changes company affiliation mid-term in a way
        that is incompatible with the Company representation policies in
        this Charter, the individual will be considered to have resigned
        their seat and the first eligible runner-up from the previous
        election will replace them for the duration of the term. If there
        is no first runner-up eligible to serve in the as per these rules,
        then the Steering Committee shall vote by simple majority to replace
        the seat for the term.
    1. Because the goal of Community Seats is to increase the perspectives on
    the Steering Committee, employees of a Company that holds Contribution
    Seats are ineligible to be elected to hold a Community Seat.
    1. Community Seat elections are held immediately after the ratification
    of the Contribution Seat assignment for a given year, such that the whole
    Steering Committee starts their term together upon the completion of the
    election.
1. A simple majority of Seats shall be sufficient to call a vote of the
Steering Committee, one nominating, and the rest agreeing, over email. Voting
shall be done electronically, in a manner agreed on by the Steering Committee.
Voting shall be open for nine calendar days, after which point it shall close.
If at any point all the Steering Committee members have voted or abstained,
voting shall close.
1. An affirmative vote of at least 60% of the Seats shall be the decision of
the Steering Committee. However, any changes to the Steering Committee Charter
shall require an affirmative vote of at least 80% of the Seats.
