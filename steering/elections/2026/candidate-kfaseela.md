### About me

I am a long-standing contributor to Istio across documentation, integration tests, release engineering, security and networking for over four years. I currently serve as a Documentation, Test, and Release Maintainer and have been an elected member of the Istio Steering Committee since 2022.

I have served as Release Manager for multiple Istio releases, coordinating contributors across working groups to ensure high-quality, stable deliveries. I have contributed to improving release processes, strengthening test infrastructure, and making contributor onboarding more scalable and sustainable.I continue to actively promote Istio through blogs, conference talks, panels, and workshops at major open source and cloud-native events, helping expand awareness, share real-world adoption stories, and bring new contributors into the community.

Beyond Istio, my broader CNCF involvement has grown significantly in 2025. I was honored to be elected to the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC), where I currently serve as a TOC member and act as the TAG Security & Compliance liaison. In the same year, I served as Co-Chair for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon (North America and Europe 2025), and I will also serve as Co-Chair for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2026, helping shape the global technical program and elevate diverse community voices across the ecosystem.

I am actively involved in growing the Istio contributor community. I serve as an LFX Mentor for Istio projects and have regularly led and participated in Istio ContribFest sessions at KubeCons, helping newcomers make their first contributions and lower the barrier to entry. I also co-chaired IstioDay events and contributed to strengthening Istio’s presence across major CNCF conferences.

I was part of the CNPA (Cloud Native Platform Associate) exam advisory board representing Istio and collaborated with the CNCF Training & Certification team on the Istio Certified Associate (ICA) exam, helping shape structured learning and certification pathways for practitioners.

I am a CNCF Ambassador and continue to advocate for open source sustainability, security, and inclusive contributor growth across the ecosystem. In recognition of sustained community contributions, I received the CNCF “Chop Wood Carry Water” award in 2023. I also co-authored the Istio Phippy book “Izzy Saves the Birthday,” aimed at making cloud-native concepts more approachable and inclusive for newcomers. I am also a co-organizer of the Cloud Native Community Group (Cloud Native Aachen), actively building regional cloud-native engagement and strengthening community connections within the CNCF ecosystem.

I have also been actively involved in advancing Istio adoption in telco-cloud and 5G transformation initiatives and collaborating with the Kubernetes supply chain security community on efforts such as Kubernetes BOM tooling for external projects like Istio.


### Why I'm running

I am running for another term to continue serving the Istio community with a focus on sustainable governance, inclusive contributor growth, strong release quality, and ecosystem alignment.

With experience spanning project maintainership, Steering governance, CNCF TOC leadership, certification programs, mentorship, and global event leadership, I hope to continue representing diverse users and contributors while helping guide Istio’s evolution in different areas such as security, release-management, advocacy and outreach and long-term project sustainability.

It would be an honor to continue serving the community on the Steering Committee.
