### About me

I joined the Istio community in its early days and have been continuously active ever since.
Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of collaborating with many outstanding contributors to help make Istio more reliable, efficient, and successful.

I have witnessed the rise of service mesh and Istio’s evolution from a distributed control plane to monolithic `istiod`, and now toward production-ready ambient mesh.

As an early contributor, I have remained deeply involved in the project. I continue to submit PRs, review code, and participate in issue discussions on a daily basis.

In addition, I have:

- served as a steering committee member for many terms 
- a core maintainer of networking and security WG
- one of the advocates of istio in China and also helped organize IstioCon in China
- author of Cloud Native Service Mesh Istio, the best-selling service mesh book in China
- publicly speaking about istio in KubeCon and IstioCon.

### Why I'm running

I have been dedicated to open source Istio for the past eight years.
As an experienced user, developer, and maintainer, I want to represent these perspectives and help keep the Istio community:

- neutral without bias
- open without occlusion

2026 is a pivotal year for Istio. As AI rapidly moves into mainstream production, Istio must evolve to handle AI traffic as a first-class workload.
I am currently focused on AI inference and agentic infrastructure, and I am committed to helping the community turn that momentum into practical, scalable, and open capabilities that make Istio the best platform for AI-native production systems.
