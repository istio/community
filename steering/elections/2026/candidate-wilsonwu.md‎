### About me

Software engineering leader with nearly 20 years of experience in Cloud Native Enterprise Solutions and AI Business Applications,
specializing in Containers, Microservices, DevOps, AI, and R&D team management.
Maintainer and member of top Open Source projects including Kubernetes, Istio, Contour, ArgoCD and vLLM;
former Microsoft Evangelist and Philips Architect. Now focused on engineering management,
leading AI/ML and LLM teams, specializing in AI Infra/AIOps, LLM Inference, and AI Gateway architectures.

### Why I'm running

As a member of the Istio Community Steering Committee in 2025, I have closely tracked the evolution of microservices
and service mesh technologies represented by Istio, and actively engaged with the latest developments across the community.

In today’s rapidly advancing AI landscape, Istio stands out as a platform-level infrastructure that integrates security,
reliability, and high performance. With the continued maturation of Ambient mode and strong alignment with the Gateway API and Gateway API Inference Extension,
Istio is well positioned to play a foundational role in AI-native architectures. I believe these innovations significantly strengthen
Istio’s relevance in next-generation cloud and AI workloads. DaoCloud’s products also adopt Istio Gateway as the north–south gateway for AI infrastructure.
In large-scale production environments, its stability, performance efficiency, and operational maturity have been fully validated,
further demonstrating Istio’s capability as a reliable foundation for enterprise-grade AI systems.


Over the past year, I have been deeply involved in maintaining the Istio Chinese documentation,
helping Chinese-speaking users efficiently access and understand the latest technical updates.
In parallel, I have contributed to improving the quality and clarity of the English documentation.
Through this work, I have developed a thorough understanding of Istio’s architectural evolution and feature implementation,
enabling me to more effectively translate community advancements into practical designs for commercial service mesh products.

In my professional role, I have delivered Istio-based service mesh solutions to multiple well-known enterprise clients.
From production-grade Sidecar deployments to forward-looking Ambient architecture planning,
I have helped organizations evaluate both immediate operational benefits and long-term architectural value.
Istio’s maturity, performance characteristics, and stability consistently provide measurable advantages for large-scale enterprise environments.

Looking ahead, I remain committed to deepening my engagement with the Istio community.
I aim to contribute not only through documentation, but increasingly through functional enhancements and feature iteration.
By bridging community innovation and real-world enterprise needs—particularly through DaoCloud’s service mesh offerings—I hope to bring timely,
first-hand community advancements to organizations running Istio in production, and further expand the practical impact of my contributions.
