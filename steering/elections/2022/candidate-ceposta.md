### Here's a paragraph about my contributions to Istio.

I've been a very active member in the Istio community contributing on Slack, in Github, delivering public trainings/workshops, and publishing multiple books including Istio in Action. Recently, I was also very involved with the contribution of ambient mesh to Istio as well.

### Here's a paragraph about why I'm running.

Istio is the most dominant, most deployed service mesh in the world and I have been a contributor to this success. I want to see Istio continue this moment, especially going into the CNCF, and advocate on its behalf to drive innovation, more adoption, and build more community contributorship.
