# Here's a paragraph about my contributions to Istio.

I have joined istio community for almost 5 years. Since then, I have collaborated with so many amazing guys to make istio efficient and successful.
I witnessed the prosperity of service mesh and the evolution of istio from distributed components to monolithic istiod and maybe ambient mesh production ready next year.

Being lucky to join istio at the very beginning, I am one of the top contributors in community and have made totally 14,160 contributions to istio community. 
And even today I am always keeping filing PRs, reviewing PRs and commenting issues every day. Because I am keen on istio, I am still working in the frontier. 
I always make myself encouraged and focused on istio community, last year I made nearly 4k contributions.

I have done many other works these years:
- served as a steering committee member in the last two years 
- a core maintainer of networking and security WG
- one of the advocates of istio in China and also helped organize IstioCon in China
- author of Cloud Native Service Mesh Istio, the best-selling service mesh book in China
- publicly speaking about istio in KubeCon and IstioCon.


# Here's a paragraph about why I'm running.

I have been devoted to open source istio for the last five years. 
And as an experienced user/developer/maintainer, I would like to represent these groups to
help make istio community:
* neutral without bias
* open without occlusion

2023 is a very important year, every one would want to see istio graduate from CNCF, I am very willing to grow with istio in the next year.
