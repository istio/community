### About me
I'm a contributor to Istio and a Founding Engineer at Tetrate. I co-authored _Istio: Up and Running_ and help actively develop microservice security standards with the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/) through _[NIST SPs 800-204A, Building Secure Microservices-based Applications Using Service-Mesh Architecture](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-204A.pdf)_ and _[SP 800-204B, Attribute-based Access Control for Microservices-based Applications using a Service Mesh](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-204B.pdf)_. These have also been adopted by industry standards including the [FFIEC](https://ithandbook.ffiec.gov/it-booklets/architecture,-infrastructure,-and-operations/vii-evolving-technologies/viic-microservices.aspx) and by the US Federal Government as part of [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/)'s _[Cloud Technical Reference Architecture](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cloud%20Security%20Technical%20Reference%20Architecture.pdf)_.

At Tetrate I help enable Istio adoption in enterprise organizations around the world. I help direct our product strategy, extending OSS Istio to meet the needs of complex enterprise use cases, and help oversee Tetrate's work on Envoy -- which powers Istio. I work day-in and day-out with teams deploying Istio in production serving critical traffic. Before Tetrate, I worked at Google as one of the earliest members of the Istio team -- I helped design and implement the (now-defunct) Mixer component and helped design and implement Istio's Networking APIs.

I currently sit in my second term as a community-elected member of Istio's Steering Committee, where I also help lead the Code of Conduct (CoC) sub-committee.

### Why I'm Running
For the last two years I've helped bring empathy, balance, and a user-focus to the Steering Committee. My experience with Istio deployments at large, highly regulated organizations (including banks, payment card processors, the DoD, and others) across many industries as well as my relationships with the existing Steering members makes me uniquely suited to continue to help guide the project.
