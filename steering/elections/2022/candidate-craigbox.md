_I am leaving Google on the 10th of October and thus am running as an independent candidate in this election.  My new employer is not currently involved in the Istio project._

### About me

I have worked on Cloud Native since joining Google, supporting Kubernetes since 2014 and Istio since 2016. I have focused on the Istio project since 2020, joining the Steering Committee as a representative of Google.  During that time, I have:

- led the journey of Istio into the CNCF (within Google and within the community); including [application of Istio to the CNCF](https://istio.io/latest/blog/2022/istio-has-applied-to-join-the-cncf/), [due diligence](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cQiigR5WHQHvo_krUXO6uEaGSB2dWNRkR0cHCAoF5QA/edit#) and [acceptance](https://istio.io/latest/blog/2022/istio-accepted-into-cncf/)
- led the program to [overhaul Istio steering](https://istio.io/latest/blog/2020/steering-changes/), adding community representation and diversifying corporate representation beyond the project founders
  - designed & run the Contribution Seat selection process
  - run three Community Seat elections (including this one<super>†</super>)
- led the redesign of istio.io, including adding advocacy material and improving readability of documentation
- written announcement blogs for several key features (including [istiod](https://istio.io/latest/blog/2020/istiod/), [WebAssembly](https://istio.io/latest/blog/2020/wasm-announce/), and [ambient mesh](https://istio.io/latest/blog/2022/introducing-ambient-mesh/)
- written release announcements for several minor releases
- been a [top 10 contributor](https://istio.teststats.cncf.io/d/9/developer-activity-counts-by-repository-group-table?orgId=1&var-period_name=Last%20year&var-metric=contributions&var-repogroup_name=All&var-country_name=All) (last 12 months) with ~1,000 PR reviews total
- served as Program Committee chair for IstioCon 2021 and mentor for PC chair for IstioCon 2022
- increased support for our Chinse community by setting up dedicated IstioCon sessions in China's time zone, supporting Chinese documentation efforts and keynoting the [Istio Community Meetup in China](https://istio.io/latest/blog/2021/istio-community-meetup-china/)
- administered the Istio Slack and led moderation for [discuss.istio.io](https://discuss.istio.io/)
- represented the Istio project as Program Committee chair for multiple ServiceMeshCon events, including [the upcoming event](https://servicemeshconna22.sched.com/)
- hosted the [Kubernetes Podcast](https://kubernetespodcast.com/), where I have featured many Istio team members: including [Justin and Ethan](https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/189-ambient-mesh/), [Mitch](https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/177-istiocon/), [Lin](https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/086-invention-ibm-istio/), [Louis](https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/058-istio-1.2/) and [Dan and Jasmine](https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/015-istio/)

### Why I'm running

I'm running for a Community Seat on the Steering Committee because I believe in the project and want to see it continue to grow.  If elected, I look forward to continuing to drive the process of integration with the CNCF, and leading the project's application for graduated status in 2023.  I will continue to work to have the perception of the project catch up with the change that has been made to simplify it, and work with vendors and the CNCF to get more investment into improving the project documentation.
