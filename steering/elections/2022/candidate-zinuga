Here's a paragraph about my contributions to Istio.
I was one of the creators of Istio back when it was launched in 2017 and then started Tetrate in 2018 to take it to enterprise. Tetrate today is helping many organizations adopt it and making contributions in gap areas like VM, WASM, multi-cluster, debuggability etc 
Here's a paragraph about why I'm running.
Steering needs to position Tetrate for adoption in the industry and focus on simplification of project, create clean goloden paths for users and make it even more relevant in the industry especially now that it goes into CNCF. I can help in this mission.
