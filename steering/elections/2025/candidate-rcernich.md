### About me

I lead the the team within Red Hat who support and maintain Istio and Envoy.
I have been a member of the Istio Steering Committee for the past three and
a half years.  Prior to that, I worked on various areas of Istio, most notably
adding the generation of proper Kubernetes type objects to istio/api, which
could be used with standard Kubernetes go-client tooling.  I am also an Istio
maintainer.

I have worked with opensource communities for over 20 years across various
organizations, including The Eclipse Foundation, JBoss.org, and Istio.  I am
a strong believer in the benefits of open source software, and believe in
putting community interests first.  Without vibrant communities, open source
would not be the same.

### Why I'm running

I would like to work with Istio leadership to find ways to grow the Istio
community.  I would like to see more avenues for contributions, e.g. the
sail-operator; things which might improve users' experiences with Istio, but
may not be applicable as part of the core engine.  I am a strong believer in
open source software and will do my best to advocate on behalf of _all_ members
of the Istio community.
