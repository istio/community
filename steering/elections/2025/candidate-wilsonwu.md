### About me

Software Development Expert with almost 20 years of experience in Cloud Native, Enterprise Solution and Engineering Management. Highly experienced in Container, Microservices, DevOps, AI, Open Source and R&D Team Management. As Top Open-Source projects maintainer and member roles such as Kubernetes, Istio, Argo CD and so on. Ex-Microsoft Evangelist and ex-Philips Architect. Focus on Software Engineering Management now and keep up with advanced technology.

### Why I'm running

As a member of the Istio community, I always pay attention to the development of service mesh technology represented by Istio, and participate in the latest community updates as soon as possible. In the past few years, I have focused on the maintenance of Istio Chinese documents, and am committed to helping users who use Chinese as a common language to obtain Istio's various technical updates as quickly as possible. While contributing Chinese documents, I also help improve the quality of English documents. Based on these contributions, I have a deep understanding of the implementation logic of Istio's various updates and related functions, which allows me to better apply them to the design of commercial mesh products at work. In the future, I still hope to continue to participate in Istio's related work and strive to expand the contribution content from documents to actual functions. Thank you!
