### About me

I lead the Istio team at DaoCloud. My active involvement with the Istio community commenced in 2019 and since then, I have made significant contributions in several fields such as Environment and User Experience. Moreover, I have pioneered the Chinese translation of Istio from its version 1.9, thereby facilitating its spread and increased contribution within China. In parallel, in my capacity as an Istio service provider, I have successfully guided many Chinese enterprises towards the effective utilization of Istio in production environments.
My participation in a multitude of community activities is consistent and proactive, which include events such as IstioCon, KCD, and Meetups. I am dedicated to disseminating information about the latest developments and best practices of Istio.
In my endeavor to support Istio, I have initiated projects such as Merbridge. It is a venture based on eBPF acceleration for Istio that enhances the assurance of enterprises when opting for Istio.

### Why I'm running

With the recent graduation of the Istio project, it is my belief that its user base will expand progressively. I aim to disseminate our experiences to a wider audience to aid them in comprehending and utilizing Istio more effectively. Concurrently, I persist in motivating more individuals to engage in the Istio community, with the joint objective of fostering the community's growth. I am delighted to participate in the development and discussion of new features in Istio and am committed to ongoing contributions to the community.
