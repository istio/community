### About me

I joined the Istio project in 2018, and serve in a variety of roles, including leading our User Experience and Upgrade work, serving on the technical oversight committee, and hosting events, including our first ever in person event, Istio Day EU 2023.  I am a CNCF Ambassador, and spend a lot of time at conferences, blog posts, and podcasts, sharing how Istio interacts with other CNCF technologies, such as Argo, Flux, and Crossplane.  Though I've been a software engineer for 18 years, my five years at Istio represent the longest time I've spent on any one project.  The Istio project feels like home to me, and I look forward to many more years of delivering best in class service mesh experience to our users.

### Why I'm running

I am incredibly proud of what we've all accomplished together, from v1.0 in 2018 to our Graduation this year!  In order to continue in our tradition of excellence, I believe the steering committee is in need of two changes.  

First, the committee needs to make significant moves towards openness and transparency.  Today, all steering committee meetings are closed, and all votes are secret.  This makes it very difficult to cast an intelligent vote for a community seat, as voters are unaware of the candidatess voting record, or even if they regularly attend scheduled meetings.  Moreover, this level of secrecy is inappropriate for a major CNCF project.  This can be easily corrected by making meetings open to the public, and using a publicly accessible voting platform, such as that used by the CNCF TOC.

Second, the committee needs to identify policies and procedures that reflect the new makeup of the Istio project.  Our previous structure of multiple working groups where designs are discussed and approved was discarded 18 months ago, as it was causing undue burden on forward progress of new features and improvements.  Unfortunately, we have yet to develop new structures, so the project has operated for the last year without a clear process for design reviews and approvals, or feature maturity progression.  What worked for Istio years ago as an independent project may not work for us today as a CNCF Graduated Project, and the Steering Committee needs to take responsibility for restructuring the project in a way that makes sense for us today, so that we can begin to follow our own policies and procedures.

I believe that great things are ahead for the Istio Project, and I hope you will join me in ensuring that the Istio Steering Committee meets the needs of our project for years to come.  Thank you.
