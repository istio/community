### About me

I lead the Istio team at Microsoft, and facilitated the integration of the team behind Open Service Mesh into the Istio community. I first got involved with Istio as an end-user of the project in 2020, and since then, I have been active in the service mesh community as a maintainer of Service Mesh Interface, a founder of Gateway API's GAMMA initiative, a maintainer on Istio's Product Security Working Group. Lately, I've been spending a lot of my time driving the design and implementation of Istio Ambient mesh. 

### Why I'm running

I believe an emphasis on accessibility is important for Istio's continued success. New users need robust APIs, lowered total cost of ownership, and a minimal barrier to entry; I am encouraged by the progress we've made on Ambient mesh to address these needs! New contributors need the support of effective community processes an onboarding ramp of good first issues. I feel that my experiences as an end-user, relatively new contributor, and maintainer have given me a unique perspective that would aid my service to the Istio community. I would be honored to serve on the steering committee and help Istio continue to grow and thrive.
