### About me

I have been deeply involved with the Istio service mesh since its inception in 2017 and currently serve on the Istio Technical Oversight Committee. As an Istio maintainer, I actively contribute to various working groups, including Build Test Release (BTR), Networking, and Environment. My responsibilities extend to maintaining the overall Istio repository, the enhancements repository, and other repositories within the Istio-ecosystem organization. With over 8500 contributions (including 350+ PRs) to the Istio project, I am dedicated to continuing my support and contributions to its development (source: [Istio’s devstats](https://istio.teststats.cncf.io/d/66/developer-activity-counts-by-companies)).

I have authored two books, "Istio Explained" and "Istio Ambient Explained," to help users easily grasp the concepts of Istio. As a passionate advocate of Istio and service mesh technology, I regularly speak at cloud-native conferences worldwide and actively blog on platforms like CNCF, InfoQ, and The New Stack, sharing my excitement and technical insights about Istio and ambient mesh. Recently, I have been closely collaborated with Istio contributors to launch ambient last September, drive ambient to alpha in May, and now to beta stage next.

In the past, I had the honor of serving as the conference co-chair for IstioCon 2021 and 2022, as well as being part of the Istio Steering Committee for four years. Additionally, I took on the roles of Istio 1.2’s release manager, BTR’s working group lead, and a member of Istio’s Product Security working group.

### Why I'm Running

As an open-source enthusiast, I firmly believe that Istio will emerge as the dominant service mesh in the industry. My passion lies in advocating for Istio and assisting users in successfully adopting this powerful platform. If elected, I am committed to contributing to various aspects that will make Istio a resounding success.

My primary goals include promoting Istio as a simple and exciting solution, ensuring its clear differentiation and relationship with other projects within the cloud-native ecosystem. I aim to establish guiding principles for the project's development, fostering a positive environment that benefits developers, contributors, vendors, and users alike. Moreover, I am prepared to provide neutral mediation for non-technical disputes, ensuring a harmonious community.

Being fluent in both English and Chinese, I can effectively address concerns raised within our diverse English and Chinese community, further strengthening Istio's global outreach.
