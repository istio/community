# 2021 Istio Steering Committee election guide

The Steering Committee is composed of nine (9) Contribution Seats and four (4) Community Seats. The role of this election is to elect the four Community Seats to the Istio Steering Committee for a one-year term.

## Background

The Istio Steering Committee oversees the administrative aspects of the project, including governance, marketing and community health. Steering exists to allow the Technical Oversight Committee to exclusively focus on the technical aspects of the project.

Some direct responsibilities of steering members to consider as you are deciding whether to run or who to vote for:

- Establishing and enforcing principles to guide the Istio project.
- Fostering an environment for a healthy and happy community of developers, contributors, vendors, and users.
- Defining, evolving, and defending a Code of Conduct.
- Setting marketing and advocacy direction for the project; establishing a publishing schedule and vetting content, encouraging and assisting community members in creating content for conferences, fostering an ecosystem of vendors.
- Providing neutral mediation as appropriate to try to resolve non-technical disputes that arise as part of the project.

## Candidacy process

Eligibility for candidacy is defined in the [Steering Committee charter](../../CHARTER.md) as a [project member](../../../ROLES.md#member) who does not work for a Company that holds a Contribution Seat.

Members from **Google**, **IBM**, **Red Hat** and **Salesforce** are therefore **ineligible** to stand in this election.

You may nominate yourself or others for election by creating an issue in the istio/community repository.  Please use the title "Nomination - Jane Doe".  Nominees should close the issue with a comment if they choose to not accept the nomination.

Nominees, if eligible, should submit a Pull Request with a biography with a maximum 300 word statement. See [sample janedoe.md](../sample-janedoe.md).

## Voting process

Eligibility to vote is defined in the [Steering Committee charter](../../CHARTER.md) as either:

- a project member who has had at least one Pull Request merged in the past 12 months, or
- someone who has submitted the [voting exception form](https://forms.gle/gvJemYA9ECey3K7b6) and has been accepted by the steering committee as having standing in the community.

Elections will be held using time-limited Condorcet ranking on CIVS using the IRV method.
The top four candidates who are employed by a unique Company (as defined in the Charter) shall be deemed to be elected.

The election will open for voting starting July 12th via email and end two weeks after on July 25, 2020 at 2359 UTC. You will receive an email to the address on file at the start of the election from `Craig Box (CIVS Poll Supervisor) <civs@cs.cornell.edu>`. Detailed voting instructions will be provided in the email and on the CIVS polling page. Please note that email can be unreliable, so you are encouraged to contact the election officials if you do not receive a ballot by July 9.
