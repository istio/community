Here's a paragraph about my contributions to Istio.

Lin has worked on Istio service mesh since 2017 and currently serves on the Istio Technical Oversight Committee. She is also an Istio maintainer of the Build Test Release (BTR) working group, Networking working group and Environment working group. She maintains the overall Istio repository, the enhancements repository and the repositories in the istio-ecosystem organization. 

Previously, she served on the Istio Steering Committee for three years. She also served as Istio 1.2’s release manager, BTR’s working group lead and member of the Istio’s Product Security working group. She has made 6000+ contributions (including 300+ PRs) to the Istio project per Istio’s [devstats](https://istio.teststats.cncf.io/d/66/developer-activity-counts-by-companies). She is the co-author of the book "Istio Explained" and a frequent Istio and Service mesh speaker around the globe for many cloud native conferences.

Here's a paragraph about why I'm running.
