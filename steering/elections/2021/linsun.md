### Here's a paragraph about my contributions to Istio:

Lin has worked on Istio service mesh since 2017 and currently serves on the Istio Technical Oversight Committee. She is also an Istio maintainer of the Build Test Release (BTR) working group, Networking working group, and Environment working group. She maintains the overall Istio repository, the enhancements repository, and the repositories in the Istio-ecosystem organization. She has made 6000+ contributions (including 300+ PRs) to the Istio project (per Istio’s devstats) and is committed to continue contributing to Istio. She is the co-author of the book "Istio Explained" and multiple free Istio workshops. She is a frequent Istio and service mesh speaker at cloud-native conferences and an active blogger.
Previously, Lin was the conference co-chair for IstioCon 2021 and served on the Istio Steering Committee for three years. She also served as Istio 1.2’s release manager, BTR’s working group lead, and a member of Istio’s Product Security working group.

### Here's a paragraph about why I'm running:

I am an open-source enthusiast and firm believer that Istio will become the dominant service mesh. I am passionate about advocating for Istio in the service mesh industry and helping users adopt Istio successfully. If elected, I would love to help out with various aspects of making Istio successful, such as enforcing principles to guide the project or fostering an environment for happy developers, contributors, vendors, and users, and providing neutral mediation for non-technical disputes. I speak Chinese fluently in addition to English and can help resolve concerns raised around our Chinese community.
