Neeraj Poddar is the Co-founder and the Chief Architect at Aspen Mesh. He has
worked on various aspects of operating systems, networking and distributed
systems over the span of his career. He is passionate about developing efficient
and performant distributed applications.  He's an open source enthusiast and is
currently an Istio Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) and Steering Committee member.
When not working on service meshes, you can find him playing
racquetball and gaining back the calories spent playing by trying out new
restaurants.

I want to continue my work in Istio and help further grow the community by
helping out in both technical and administrative aspects of the project which is
why I'm running for Steering elections again in 2021.
