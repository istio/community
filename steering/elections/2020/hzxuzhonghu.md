# Bio
I (@hzxuzhonghu) joined in 2018 as a contributor. Over the last two years, I have loved working with so many amazing contributors collaboratively build an amazing community and witnessed the prosperity of service mesh and especially Istio. I have become one of the earliest maintainers of Istio and contributed many features like locality load balancing, virtual service delegation, and better VM support and also committed to performance, scalability and reliability. I am one of the top contributors and have made totally 5,628 contributions to Istio community since beginning and will continue on.

I am one of the earliest advocates of service mesh Istio in China and help users get started with Istio. Author of Cloud Native Service Mesh Istio, the best-selling service mesh book in China. I am also an open-source enthusiast and contributors on Kubernetes and Volcano. Currently I am totally focused on micro-service, service mesh, Kubernetes, containerization and dedicated on cloud native application.

If elected, I aim to bring the voice of the contributors to the steering table. I hope to provide neutral mediation to try to solve non-technical disputes, and do the hard work needed to foster an environment which is healthy for contributors, end-users and vendors.
