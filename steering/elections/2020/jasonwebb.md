# Bio
Jason Webb [@Jason Webb (Intuit)] has been involved in with Istio since 2018 and is currently the CNCF Service Mesh End User Group co-chair.   The CNCF Service Mesh End User Group is composed of over 30+ companies that gather to share best practices and discuss findings as they adopt and deploy Service Mesh technologies at their companies.  In bringing Istio to Intuit, Jason developed automation and learned how to scale Istio across multiple clusters. After collaborating with Istio security and networking working groups, Jason refined the approach and published the Istio ecosystem project Admiral.  The development of Admiral involved collaboration with security and networking Istio working groups.  Jason co-presented Admiral at Kubecon North America 2019, demonstrating the ability to perform global routing in a multi-cluster Istio deployment.  As the CNCF Service Mesh End User group co-chair, Jason would bring the End User perspective to the steering committee enabling the Service Mesh to have a broader impact on the enterprise.
