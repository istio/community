# Contribution seat allocation formula

The [steering committee charter](CHARTER.md) states "Each year, when
Contribution Seat terms begin, the Steering Committee will vote on an exact
formula and procedure for determining allocation for the following year."

For the August 2020 to January 2021 term, the contribution formula shall be
**merged pull requests** attributed to a Contributing Company,
and the [D'Hondt method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Hondt_method) of
allocation of seats.

Attribution is done using the company attribution table used by the
istio-policy-bot. Requests for changes to attribution can be made by e-mail
to elections@discuss.istio.io.

[The method and results are published here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dt-h9s8G7Wyt4r16ZVqcmdWXDuCaPC0kPS21BuAfCL8/edit#gid=0).
