# Bugs and Feature Requests

You can report bugs and feature requests to the Istio team in one of three places:

- [Product Bugs and Feature Requests](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues)
- [Documentation Bugs and Feature Requests](https://github.com/istio/istio.io/issues)
- [Community and Governance Issues](https://github.com/istio/community/issues)

For security vulnerabilities, please don't report a bug (which is public) and instead follow
[these procedures](https://istio.io/about/security-vulnerabilities/).
