## How Can I Help ?

See also https://istio.io/community/

Documentation (like the text you are reading now) can always use improvement!

There's a [list of issues](https://github.com/istio/issues/issues) that should not need deep knowledge of the system.

To dig deeper, read a design doc, e.g. [architecture](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/overview.html#architecture).

There's always code that can be clarified and variables or functions that can be renamed or commented.

There's always a need for more test coverage.
