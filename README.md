## Introduction

Istio is an open platform for providing a uniform way to integrate
microservices, manage traffic flow across microservices, enforce policies
and aggregate telemetry data. Istio's control plane provides an abstraction
layer over the underlying cluster management platform, such as Kubernetes,
Mesos, etc.

Visit [istio.io](https://istio.io) for in-depth information about using Istio.

## Istio authors
Istio is an open source project with an active development community. The project was started
by teams from Google and IBM, in partnership with the Envoy team at Lyft.

## Community meeting

We have public, [recorded](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-zVlo1F3mUbExQ96fABWcQ), community meetings.
They happen on the fourth Thursday of every month at 10am US/Pacific. [Map that to your local time](https://time.is/compare/1000_in_San_Francisco,_California).

[Join this group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/istio-community-video-meetings)
to have the meetings automatically added to your calendar.
You can also find them on [the community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=i10ogf58krfbrsjai5qi16g4do%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles), along with other major community events.

Meeting agendas and notes can be accessed in the [working doc](http://bit.ly/istiocommunitymeet).

## How can I help ?

See our [community page](https://istio.io/about/community/) for ways to get involved
in our community.

To dig deeper, check out the [architecture](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/#architecture)
and read some [design docs](./CONTRIBUTING.md#design-documents).

If you're looking for something to do to get your feet wet working on Istio, look for GitHub issues
marked with the Help Wanted label:

- [Primary Istio repo](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22community%2Fhelp+wanted%22)
- [Documentation repo](https://github.com/istio/istio.io/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

Of course, even if there's not an issue opened for it, we can always use more
testing throughout the platform. Similarly, we can always use more docs, richer docs,
insightful docs. Or maybe a cool blog post?
