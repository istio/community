name: Early Security Vulnerability Disclosure Membership Request
about: Request membership in Istio's early vulnerability disclosure program.
---

As described in [Security Vulnerabilities](/about/security-vulnerabilities/), Istio maintains a mailing
list for early disclosure of security vulnerabilities.
This list is used to provide actionable information to multiple distribution
vendors at once. This list is not intended for individuals to find out about
security issues.

This form lets you request to be added to the mailing list.
Please read the material below before submitting the form to make sure
you understand the purpose of the list and your role as a list member.

### Embargo policy

The information members receive through the early disclosure list must not be
made public, shared, nor even hinted at anywhere beyond the need-to-know within
your specific team except with the list's explicit approval. This holds
true until the public disclosure.
Members of the list and others may not use the information for anything other
than getting the issue fixed for your respective distribution's users.

Before any information from the list is shared with respective members of your
team required to fix said issue, they must agree to the same terms and only
find out information on a need-to-know basis.

In the unfortunate event you share the information beyond what is allowed by
this policy, you _must_ urgently inform the mailing list
of exactly what information
leaked and to whom. If you continue to leak information and break the policy outlined here, you
will be removed from the list.
