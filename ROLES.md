## Collaborator

Individuals may be added as an outside collaborator (with READ access) to a repo in the Istio GitHub organization without becoming a member.
This allows them to be assigned issues and PRs until they become a member, but will not allow tests to be run against their PRs automatically
nor allow them to interact with the PR bot.

### Requirements

* Working on some contribution to the project that would benefit from the ability to have PRs or Issues to be assigned to the contributor

* <a href="#sponsor">Sponsored</a> by 1 member

## Member

Established community members are expected to demonstrate their adherence to the principles in this document, familiarity with project
organization, roles, policies, procedures, conventions, etc., and technical and/or writing ability.

Members are continuously active contributors in the community. They can have issues and PRs assigned to them, participate in working group
meetings, and pre-submit tests are automatically run for their PRs. Members are expected to remain active contributors to the community.

All members are encouraged to help with the code review burden, although each PR must be reviewed by one or more official maintainers for
the area before being accepted into the source base.

### Requirements

* Has pushed at least one PR to the Istio repositories within the last 6 months.

* Subscribed to [contributors](https://discuss.istio.io/c/contributors)

* Actively contributing to 1 or more areas.

Members are expected to be active participants in the project on an on-going basis. If an individual doesn't contribute to the project for
a 180 day period, than that individual may lose membership. On-going contributions include:

- Successfully merging pull requests
- Triaging issues or pull requests
- Commenting on issues or pull requests
- Closing issues or pull requests

### Becoming a member

If you are interested in becoming a member and meet the requirements above, you can join the organization by adding yourself to the members list under [`org/istio.yaml`](org/istio.yaml). Once that has been done, submit a Pull Request with the change and fill out the pull request template with all information requested.

### Responsibilities and privileges

* Responsive to issues and PRs assigned to them

* Active owner of code they have contributed (unless ownership is explicitly transferred)

    * Code is well tested

    * Tests consistently pass

    * Addresses bugs or issues discovered after code is accepted

Members who frequently contribute code are expected to proactively perform code reviews for the area that they are active in.

## Documentation Reviewer

A **Documentation Reviewer** is trusted to only approve
content that meets the acceptance criteria described in the
[contribution guides](https://istio.io/about/contribute/).

### Requirements

To become a **Reviewer**, contributors must meet the following **requirements**:

* Be a **Member** of the Istio community.
* Perform 5 substantial contributions to the `istio.io` repo. Substantial
  contributions include the following examples:

    * New content
    * Content reviews
    * Content improvements

* Demonstrate a solid commitment to documentation quality and use of our style
  guide.
* Be sponsored by an Istio Maintainer or WG Lead.

### Responsibilities

* Review PRs in `istio/istio.io` following the process described in the
  [How to review content](https://istio.io/about/contribute/github/#review) guide.
* Ensure the relevant technical Working Group is added as a reviewer and ensure
  a WG lead or maintainer has approved the PR.

### Privileges

* Content approved by a **Reviewer** gets prioritized by Maintainers and WG Leads.
* Reviewers can place a `pre-reviewed` label to notify the Docs WG Leads and
  Maintainers to expedite publication of the pre-reviewed content.

Content reviewers can't merge content into the `istio/istio.io` master; only
Docs Maintainers and WG Leads can merge content into master.

## Maintainer

Maintainers review and approve code contributions. While code review is focused on code quality and correctness,
approval is focused on holistic acceptance of a contribution including: backwards / forwards compatibility, adhering to API and flag
conventions, subtle performance and correctness issues, interactions with other parts of the system, etc. Maintainer status is scoped to a
part of the codebase and is reflected in a CODEOWNERS file.

### Requirements

The following apply to the part of the codebase for which one would be a maintainer:

* Member for at least 3 months

* Contributed at least 30 substantial PRs to the codebase

* Must remain an active participant in the community by contributing
code, performing reviews, triaging issues, etc.

* Knowledgeable about the codebase

* Sponsored by a working group lead with no objections from other leads

If a maintainer becomes inactive in the project for an extended period of time, the individual will transition to being an
emeritus maintainer. Emeritus maintainers lose their ability to approve code contributions, but retain their voting rights
for up to one year. After one year, emeritus maintainers revert back to being normal members with no voting rights.

Maintainers contribute to the parts of the project they are responsible for by:

- Successfully merging pull requests
- Triaging issues or pull requests
- Closing issues or pull requests

### Responsibilities and privileges

The following apply to the part of the codebase for which one would be a maintainer:

* Maintainer status may be a precondition to accepting large code contributions

* Demonstrates sound technical judgement

* Responsible for project quality control via [code reviews](https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Reviewing-Pull-Requests)

    * Focus on code quality and correctness, including testing and factoring

    * Focus on holistic acceptance of contribution such as dependencies with other features, backwards / forwards compatibility, API and flag definitions, etc

* Expected to be responsive to review requests as per [community expectations](https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Reviewing-Pull-Requests);

* May approve code contributions for acceptance

* Maintainers in an area get a vote when a working group needs to make decisions.

## Triager

Triagers are members that help triage issues. They can set priority, assignment, milestones, and labels.

### Requirements

Triagers are appointed by the <a href="./TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md">technical oversight committee</a>

### Responsibilities and privileges

The following apply to the area / component for which one would be an owner.

* Perform issue triage on GitHub

* Apply/remove/create/delete GitHub labels and milestones

## Lead

Working group leads, or just ‘leads’, are maintainers of an entire area that have demonstrated good judgement and responsibility.
Leads accept design proposals and approve design decisions for their area of ownership, triage issues, and run regular working group
meetings.

* Recognized as having expertise in the group’s subject matter

by the overall rules of the project. For example, unless strictly necessary, admins should not approve and/or commit
PRs they aren't entitled to if they were not admins.
